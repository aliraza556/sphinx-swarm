# cln test

`cargo run --bin cln`

### run frontend

`cd app`

`yarn dev`

go to http://localhost:5173

login with admin/password

### wait

wait until the "setup" is done.... the "connect your signer" page will dissapear. You can see the setup steps happening in the rust backend.

In the frontend, click "+ channel" and make another channel with your peer. You can mine 1 block at a time in bitcoind in order to test channel confirmation.
